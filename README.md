# Optimizing Canada's Inflation 📈💡

## Overview
Inflation, the rise in prices over time, plays a crucial role in determining a nation’s economic stability and impacts the cost of living 💸. This study aims to forecast Canada’s inflation using a novel data-driven forecast combination approach, addressing the gap in Canadian inflation research.

Inflation is influenced by various economic factors such as exchange rates 💱, unemployment rates 📉, and more. This approach incorporates these external factors to accurately capture inflation variations. The proposed method combines time series 📊 and machine learning 🤖 models, optimizing forecast weights by minimizing the forecast error sum of squares (FESS).

## Methodology 🛠️
- **Data Sources**: Canadian inflation data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) and Bank of Canada 🏦.
- **Approach**: A combination of time series and machine learning models, bypassing traditional steps, and optimizing forecast accuracy 🎯.

## Achievements 🏆
- Awarded **Best Poster Presentation** at the **Canadian Statistics Student Conference** in **St. John, June 2024** for this research 🎉.
- The code for the forecasting approach will be released soon 🔓.

## Results 📊
The results from the numerical experiments indicate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional time series and machine learning models, offering superior accuracy and reliability in forecasting Canadian inflation. This approach provides valuable insights for policymakers 🏛️, enabling more informed decisions regarding monetary policy and inflation control.
